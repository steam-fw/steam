            <h1>Take everything you know about frameworks and throw it out the window.</h1>
            <p>Okay great, now you're ready to learn how Steam will help you create better software.</p>
            <p>Steam is a patternless framework which intelligently blends <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">object oriented</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">functional</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming" target="_blank">procedural</a> paradigms.</p>
            <h2>Wait, Steam isn't an OOP MVC Framework?</h2>
            <p>As much as we love using buzzwords to promote our software, it doesn't always make sense. Steam is beautifully organized, but it's not stricly object oriented, and it does not adhere to any single architectural pattern. Instead, it is designed with the following principles in mind:</p>
            <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilitate the rapid development of top notch, PHP-driven web applications</li>
                <li>Introduce the least number of restrictions to developers</li>
                <li>Provide the flexibility to support complex, high-traffic web applications</li>
                <li>Incorporate existing projects to reduce learning curve and increase reliability</li>
                <li>Accomplish the goals with the least amount of new code</li>
            </ul>
