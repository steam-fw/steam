            <h1>Take everything you know about frameworks and throw it out the window.</h1>
            <p>Okay great, now you're ready to learn how Steam will help you create better software.</p>
            <h2>Look Mom! No Database!</h2>
            <p>Are you building a simple site which consists of mostly static HTML pages? There's nothing
            wrong with that. For many people, a database is unnecessary. Not to worry, Steam isn't going
            to force you to use one&mdash;it's entirely your decision.</p>
            <p>The availability of web services has given us the freedom to rely upon external sites
            for dynamic content, and completely forego a database. Popular services include the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/" target="_blank">Google Data APIs</a>,
            <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" target="_blank">Facebook Graph API</a>,
            <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a>, and the
            <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API">MediaWiki API</a>.</p>
            <h2>That's great, but I'm trying to build a highly scalable, distributed system</h2>
            <p>Okay big shot, we've got you covered. Steam provides a simple interface to <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html" target="_blank">Zend Db</a> which enables seamless transition to random selection load balancing using a single master-multiple slave configuration.</p>
            <h2>Wait, Steam isn't an OOP MVC Framework?</h2>
            <p>As much as we love using buzzwords to promote our software, it doesn't always make sense. Steam is beautifully organized, but it's not object oriented and it does not adhere to any existing architectural pattern. Steam offers architectural flexibility and relies heavily on static classes which are never instantiated. This has been determined to be a superior approach for web applications.</p>
